# Observation Log – Step 6

This log provides a detailed breakdown of network and system events observed during Step 6 of the cybersecurity lab. Tools used include **Wireshark** for packet analysis and **Wazuh** for host-based monitoring.

## **1. Browsing Behavior**

### Description
The user visited the website `wikipedia.org` using a standard web browser.

### Observations
- **DNS Resolution**: The domain `wikipedia.org` resolved to the IP address `208.80.154.224`.
  - This was captured in Wireshark as a **DNS response** packet.
- **HTTP GET Request**: Following the DNS resolution, an HTTP GET request was made to the server.
  - This packet was clearly visible in Wireshark, showing the requested URL and HTTP headers.

### Explanation
When a domain is accessed, a DNS lookup occurs to resolve the domain to an IP address. Wireshark can capture both the DNS query and response. After resolution, a connection is made to the web server, and an HTTP GET request is used to retrieve webpage content. Monitoring this behavior is useful for identifying web access patterns or potential phishing attempts.

## **2. Software Installation**

### Description
The VLC media player was installed on a Windows system.

### Observations
- The installation process was monitored.
- **Wazuh** generated an alert:
  - **Event ID**: `11707`
  - **Source**: Windows Installer
  - **Message**: Application installation event detected.

### Explanation
Wazuh uses Windows event logs to track system-level changes. Event ID 11707 is generated by the **MSI installer** when an application is successfully installed. This is valuable for detecting unauthorized or unexpected software installations that may indicate policy violations or malicious activity.

## **3. Script Execution**

### Description
A PowerShell script named `wininfo.ps1` was executed.

### Observations
- The script’s output was redirected to a text file.
- Wazuh detected and flagged the script execution as a **PowerShell activity**.

### Explanation
PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment that can be used for legitimate administrative tasks or malicious actions. Wazuh monitors PowerShell activity using **Sysmon** and **event logging**, which helps in detecting suspicious scripts. Redirecting output to a file is common for logging, but should be reviewed for potential data exfiltration.

## **4. SSH Session**

### Description
An SSH session was established using **PuTTY**, a popular SSH client on Windows.

### Observations
- Wireshark captured the initial **SSH handshake**, which includes the exchange of keys and algorithms.
- Wazuh logs confirmed:
  - SSH login success
  - Source IP and user account used

### Explanation
SSH (Secure Shell) is used to securely access remote machines. The handshake process involves exchanging encryption keys. While the payload is encrypted, the initial handshake is visible in Wireshark. Monitoring SSH sessions helps identify unauthorized remote access attempts. Wazuh uses system logs (like `auth.log` on Linux or equivalent Windows logs) to track successful and failed login attempts.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By completing Step 6, interns will:

- Understand **DNS resolution** and **HTTP traffic** using packet capture tools like Wireshark.
- Detect **application installation events** using host-based intrusion detection (Wazuh).
- Analyze **script execution** and its impact on system behavior.
- Recognize and correlate **SSH session activity** across both network (Wireshark) and system logs (Wazuh).
- Gain hands-on experience with correlating events across multiple monitoring platforms.
